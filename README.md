# Fortinet - FortiOS REST API Intergration

### Hello friends,

I have decided to make a past project of mine public. Demonstrating my abilities and skills as an engineer, I aim to release this software publicly to test securities and other dynamics. Please do provide input where you see fit; thanks in advance.

### Scope

The project successfully integrates Fortinet's FortiAuthenticator & FortiOS REST API endpoints. The cloud-native web application, driven by the Pythonic *and robust*, Django web framework, went through a standard development life cycle, and the project was thoroughly tested within a UAT environment. After some time, the applications are deployed onto the client's servers.
